# GSoC_ASL_Parameters_Generator
I'll develop an automatic generator for "ASL parameters" from DICOM or nii/BIDS format images to enhance the reproducibility of scientific publications in the field of perfusion MRI. I divide the project into two parts: the backend and the frontend. The backend will extract recommended values from medical image headers. On the frontend, I'll design a user-friendly website portal, which allows easy file uploads and automated report generation. This tool will address challenges in multi-site research comparability of perfusion MRI. Planned deliverables include the software, documentation, and a set of guidelines for its application in academic contexts.
